This is a Java project that I worked on during my time in university. It was a really interesting project that helped me gain a lot of hands-on experience with Java programming. I had the opportunity to develop a robust and scalable application, implementing various Java concepts and frameworks. It was a great learning experience that honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming.
