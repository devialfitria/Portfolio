This is a UI/UX project that I worked on during my time in university. It was a captivating project that allowed me to dive into the world of user-centered design. I had the opportunity to conduct user research, create wireframes and prototypes, and design intuitive interfaces. The project challenged me to think creatively, consider user needs, and craft visually appealing designs.
