This is a SQL project that I worked on during my time in university. It was a fascinating project that provided me with valuable hands-on experience in database management and querying. I had the opportunity to design and optimize complex databases, write efficient SQL queries, and analyze large datasets. The project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of data organization and manipulation.
